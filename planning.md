# My planning

Create a folder named storytelling in the root directory. Create a markdown file called "storytelling.md" in the new folder. Update any reference md files to include this new folder.

# PERSONA PROMPT 1

In this chat, we will be using the Working Backwards Toolkit (WBT) from Korn Ferry’s Applied Enterprise Innovation (AEI) team to help my company develop new product/service ideas to delight customers and generate meaningful profitability for our business.
To start, I would like your help to build a Tool called a Persona. When I say, Persona, I do not mean “any” Persona Tool. We will specifically be using the Persona Tool that is one of several tools used in WBT that allows a business to quickly use experimentation to gain deep empathy for its customers. 
The Persona Tool is made up of four Quadrants: Facts, Goals, Pains, and Behaviours (the order matters). 
Facts are demographic, psychographic or other descriptors of ONE sample customer (not a stereotype or a representation of a larger group, we really mean one unique individual with Facts specific to them). 
Goals are the customer’s aspirations – what the customer wants (i.e.: in life or in work). However, we will limit the Goals we record in the Persona Tool to those goals that are reasonably 1) current (customer is looking to solve these goals relatively quickly) and 2) actionable (we need to be able to build a solution so the goal needs to be solvable by my company). Also, for each goal, please capture whether this Goal comes from Social, Emotional, or Functional origins. For example, a Social Goal is one derived because the customer is comparing themselves to other people whereas an Emotional Goal arises from the need to address some internal emotion. Functional Goals derive from the need to solve a specific quantitative problem (like, “I need more hard drive space”). Finally, for each Goal, we capture the Measure of Success which is what the customer might say “in their own words” if they achieved their Goal.
Pains are the things that are blocking the customer from achieving one or more of their Goals. Note that each Pain MUST link to at least 1 Goal in the Goal Quadrant. For each Pain, please explain how Urgently and Intensely the customer is feeling the Pain (how unhappy are they with the current situation) and rate each Pain’s Urgency and Intensity using a 3-point scale of High, Medium, or Low. Finally, in thinking about the Customer Journey, identify points at which the customer feels the pain most intensely (they are the most unhappy with status quo).
Behaviours are the current actions that the customer is taking to remove their Pains and achieve their Goals. The Behaviours identify the Persona as an Early Adopter, as defined in Geoffrey Moore's book "Crossing the Chasm".  Every Behaviour must link to at least one Pain in the Pain Quadrant. Please document how much effort the customer is putting into the Behaviour: “Seeking solutions” is good, “taking explicit actions” to solve is better, and any “actions they are taking that require payment or time commitment“ are best! Finally, document how efficacious each behaviour is. How well is that behaviour solving the current problem? 
OK. Those are the rules. Now let’s build a Persona. Please generate the Facts, Goals, Pains, and Behaviours. To give you a general target of the detail required, in general, good Persona’s have between 8-10 Facts, 2-3 of their most current and actionable Goals, 4-6 of their most intense and urgent Pains, and 3-5 Behaviours.
Please build a Persona with the customer details I have add in the next prompt.  Please also make sure the persona is of a customer relevant to my industry, which I will also add in the next prompt.


# PERSONA PROMPT 2
Persona Name: Mr John Doe
Persona Occupation: Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) Finance Manager
Persona Interests: Financial technology, process optimization, and customer relationship management
Persona Location: Johor Bahru, Malaysia
My Industry: Saas (Software as a Service)
Issue now:
Delayed Invoicing and Inefficient Collections Impacting Cash Flow in SaaS Businesses Context: Businesses often face fragmented billing systems, manual invoice generation, inconsistent follow-ups on overdue payments, and poor customer communication. This results in delayed revenue recognition, cash flow constraints, and strained customer relationships—especially for recurring or usage-based billing models. Agentic AI Solution: Agentic AI can act as autonomous billing and collections agents, integrated with accounting systems and customer relationship management solutions. These agents can: Generate and send invoices automatically based on usage or subscription terms. Monitor payment status in real time. Engage customers proactively for follow-ups with personalized, professional messages. Offer payment plans or escalate to finance only when needed. Learn from customer behavior (e.g., frequent late payers) to prioritize follow-ups and adjust engagement strategies. By handling the end-to-end lifecycle of invoicing and collections, Agentic AI reduces Days Sales Outstanding (DSO), enhances customer experience, and frees up finance teams for strategic tasks

# [HYPOTHESIS PROMPT]
The next tool in WBT generates the Customer Hypothesis and the Problem Hypothesis which we will use to build experiments. A Customer Hypothesis is a sentence formed by combining Facts and Behaviours. A Problem Hypothesis is a sentence formed by combining Pains and Goals. 
Given the number of Facts, Goals, Pains and Behaviours, one 'could' generate hundreds or thousands of potential hypotheses or very 'long' hypotheses. Instead, we need to narrow down to one Customer Hypothesis and one Problem Hypothesis that we will experiment with, and use our judgement to select the Customer Hypothesis and the Problem Hypothesis that we think will generate the most interesting learnings if experimented upon while optimizing for lower word count so that we can keep the costs and time of experimentation down with fewer variables in the hypotheses to test. 
Lastly, it is important that hypotheses do not refer to any solutions.  We will be exploring solutions to the pains and gaols later, so for now we want to remain as open as possible.
Appreciating the fuzziness of the request, would you please generate one of each type of hypothesis given those instructions and the Persona you just created and provide your rationale for why you chose these?  Follow that by combining the Customer Hypothesis and the Problem Hypothesis into a single paragraph, which we will call the Hypothesis.
Next, decompose the Hypothesis into 10-15 explicit and implicit Predictions that underpin the Hypothesis.

# Finnovate AI - AI & Analytics Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of a highly scalable, event-driven AI analytics system using Domain-Driven Design principles for the Finnovate AI platform. It focuses on features critical for a hackathon demo:
- Amazon Bedrock (AI agents, LLMs)
- Amazon SageMaker (ML models, forecasting)
- Amazon QuickSight (dashboards & analytics)
- Amazon Kendra (search & document indexing)

I want to add another navigation page just for this

# Storyboard

I want to make a page that looks like chatbox like chatGPT style
I will ask question and it will answer in the same page
like who is overdue payment?
the AI will retreive from the database and answer the question

question like email the overdue invoice to customer with professional tone
and show me the email before sending it out.

Or instructions like send email to this guy with new invoice I will textfully write in the chatbox and hope that the AI will do it for me,
then review the email before sending it out.

I want to tell the AI to send all the email to all the overdue customers.

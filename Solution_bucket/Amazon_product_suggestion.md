# Pitch deck plan: Finnovate AI
An Agentic Billing Intelligence and Collections Platform

It is an automated, AI-driven solution designed to streamline the entire "invoice-to-cash" process for B2B SaaS companies. The system addresses the key pain points of manual work, delayed payments, and inconsistent customer communication by using a serverless and managed services approach on the AWS Cloud. The system also includes a critical component for ensuring compliance with Malaysia's upcoming e-Invoicing regulations.

# Solution
1. Data Integration and Automation
Amazon API Gateway: To address the issue of fragmented systems, this service can be used to create APIs that allow different platforms like CRM, accounting, and payment processors to communicate with each other, centralizing data and automating workflows.
AWS Lambda: This serverless service can replace manual Excel macros by running code in response to events from other systems. For example, a Lambda function could be triggered to automatically generate an invoice once a new customer record is created in the CRM.
Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3): A secure and scalable object storage service to store all digital invoices, financial reports, and other documents in a centralized location, replacing the need for local files and manual backups.
2. AI-Driven Collections and Communication
Amazon Bedrock: This is the core of the Agentic AI solution. It provides access to foundation models that can be used to build autonomous agents for collections and billing. These agents can monitor payment status, prioritize follow-ups, and learn from customer behavior to personalize communication.
Amazon Simple Email Service (SES): The AI agents from Bedrock can use SES to send automated, personalized, and professional email reminders and follow-ups to customers with overdue payments.
Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS): This service can be used by the collections agents to send automated SMS or push notifications to customers for payment reminders or other urgent communications.
3. Financial Analysis and Visibility
Amazon SageMaker: To solve the lack of visibility into payment patterns, SageMaker can be used to build, train, and deploy machine learning models. These models can analyze historical data to forecast cash flow and identify trends in customer payment behavior, which is a major pain point for Mr. Doe.
Amazon Kendra: This intelligent search service can be used to quickly search and retrieve specific information from a vast repository of invoices, contracts, and financial documents, saving Mr. Doe from manually sifting through files to find data for strategic planning.
Amazon QuickSight: An integrated business intelligence service that can create interactive dashboards and visualizations of the data analyzed by SageMaker. This would give Mr. Doe a clear, real-time view of his company's financial health, DSO, and cash position.
4. Regulatory Compliance
AWS Marketplace: To meet the urgent e-Invoicing compliance requirements in Malaysia, you can use the AWS Marketplace. It offers pre-built, third-party solutions that are designed to be compliant with the Inland Revenue Board of Malaysia (LHDN) guidelines and can be easily integrated with your systems.
Axrail e-Invoice Solution: Specific examples of solutions found on the AWS Marketplace that provide e-invoicing middleware compliant with LHDN standards. These solutions automate the entire e-invoicing process, including pre-validation checks and real-time data exchange with LHDN's API, and help ensure compliance by the July 2025 deadline.

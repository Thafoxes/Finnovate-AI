## Hypotheses

### Customer Hypothesis
A financially sophisticated SaaS Finance Manager with extensive industry experience is personally investing time and money in payment analytics tools and compliance education while developing custom Excel systems and communication strategies to overcome billing, collection, and regulatory challenges.

**Rationale:** This hypothesis combines key facts about Mr. Doe (his role, experience, and early adopter status) with his most effortful behaviors (creating custom tracking systems, personally handling collections, researching FinTech solutions, attending compliance workshops). These elements strongly indicate he's an early adopter actively seeking solutions to his pain points.

### Problem Hypothesis
Fragmented billing systems and inconsistent collection processes, combined with looming e-Invoicing compliance requirements, prevent efficient cash flow management and strain customer relationships, hindering the ability to reduce Days Sales Outstanding and focus on strategic financial initiatives.

**Rationale:** This hypothesis combines the most urgent and intense pains (fragmented billing systems, inconsistent follow-ups, tension between collections and relationships, regulatory compliance) with his primary goals (reducing DSO, implementing automation, improving customer relationships). This problem area represents the core challenge that's preventing goal achievement.

### Combined Hypothesis
A financially sophisticated SaaS Finance Manager with extensive industry experience who is personally investing in custom solutions, analytics tools, and compliance education is unable to achieve his goals of reducing Days Sales Outstanding and improving customer relationships because fragmented systems, inconsistent processes, and upcoming regulatory requirements require excessive manual intervention and provide insufficient visibility for effective cash flow management.

## Predictions
1. SaaS Finance Managers spend at least 30% of their work week on manual invoice generation and collections activities.
2. The lack of integration between billing systems and customer relationship management tools is the primary cause of payment delays.
3. Current automated collection solutions in the market either lack personalization capabilities or don't integrate well with existing systems.
4. Finance teams prioritize collecting from larger accounts over smaller ones, potentially leaving significant cumulative revenue uncollected.
5. SaaS companies rarely allocate sufficient budget for financial process automation until cash flow problems become severe.
6. Finance Managers are willing to use personal resources (time/money) to test solutions that might improve their department's performance.
7. The tension between maintaining customer relationships and enforcing payment terms causes significant workplace stress.
8. Collection prediction is currently based more on individual customer knowledge than on data analytics.
9. Billing specialists have financial analysis skills that could be better utilized if freed from manual tasks.
10. Executive teams evaluate finance department performance primarily on DSO metrics rather than customer satisfaction with billing processes.
11. Competitors are facing similar challenges with billing and collections in subscription-based models.
12. Finance Managers would prefer solutions that integrate with existing systems rather than requiring complete system replacement.
13. The psychological stress of managing increasing accounts receivable impacts job satisfaction significantly.
14. There is insufficient standardization across different SaaS pricing models to enable one-size-fits-all collection strategies.
15. Early adopters of automated financial processes gain competitive advantages through improved cash flow and customer experiences.
16. Malaysia's e-Invoicing mandate is creating additional pressure on finance teams to modernize their systems.
17. The July 2025 compliance deadline for companies in the MYR 5M-25M revenue bracket is causing significant concern about system readiness.

## Interview Questions for Customer Discovery

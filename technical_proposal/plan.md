# Technical Implementation Plan for Finnovate AI

This plan outlines the steps to create a comprehensive technical proposal for the Finnovate AI Agentic Billing Intelligence and Collections Platform.

## Steps

- [ ] 1. Analyze the requirements from the Amazon product suggestion file
- [ ] 2. Create a high-level system architecture diagram
- [ ] 3. Design the data flow and system interactions using sequence diagrams
- [ ] 4. Define the technical implementation details for each system component:
  - [ ] 4.1. Data Integration and Automation components
  - [ ] 4.2. AI-Driven Collections and Communication components
  - [ ] 4.3. Financial Analysis and Visibility components
  - [ ] 4.4. Regulatory Compliance components
- [ ] 5. Identify implementation challenges and potential solutions
- [ ] 6. Create a security and compliance considerations section
- [ ] 7. Outline a phased implementation approach
- [ ] 8. List technical cautions and limitations to be aware of
- [ ] 9. Document AWS service configuration requirements

## Note on Critical Decisions
For any critical architectural decisions or alternative approaches, I will present options and await your confirmation before proceeding.

## Questions for Clarification
1. Is there a specific timeline for the implementation that should be considered in the proposal? 2 weeks time?
2. Are there any existing systems that need to be integrated with (beyond general CRM, accounting, and payment processors)? - Suggested Solution: Start with Stripe for payments, and generic REST API connectors for CRM/accounting. Design the integration layer to be extensible for future systems (e.g., Xero, QuickBooks, SAP).
3. Do you have a preference for a particular language/framework for the Lambda functions? - Use Python for data processing and integration tasks (widely supported, good AWS SDK), and Node.js for lightweight, event-driven functions.
4. What is the expected scale of the system in terms of number of invoices, customers, etc.? - Design for scalability from the start (serverless, DynamoDB on-demand)
5. Are there any budget constraints that should influence the technical architecture? - no budget constraints for now because this is just for hackathon purpose.
6. Can you generate some synthetic data for testing purposes?

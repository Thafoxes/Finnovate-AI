# Solution Plan: Finnovate AI (Agentic Billing Intelligence and Collections Platform)

## Solution Summary

Finnovate AI will be a modular, AWS-native, serverless platform automating the invoice-to-cash process for Malaysian SaaS companies, with a focus on e-Invoicing compliance and AI-driven collections. The solution will use the following AWS services and components:

- Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, Amazon S3 for data integration and automation
- Amazon Bedrock, SES, SNS for AI-driven collections and communication
- Amazon SageMaker, Kendra, QuickSight for analytics and visibility
- AWS Marketplace (Axrail e-Invoice Solution) for regulatory compliance

## Critical Decisions & Doubts (Require Your Confirmation)

1. **Integration Scope**: Which CRM/accounting/payment systems must be supported first? - Stripe first. Other systems can be added later as needed.
2. **Data Residency**: Are there restrictions on where financial data must be stored (e.g., only in Malaysia)? - Only in Malaysia
3. **User Roles**: What user roles and access controls are required for finance, IT, and auditors? - we will have three roles: Finance (full access to financial data and reports), IT (access to system configuration and logs), and Auditors (read-only access to financial records).
4. **Notification Channels**: Should we support WhatsApp, SMS, or only email for reminders? - we will use email for now.
5. **Customization**: How much flexibility is needed in AI agent communication templates? - One for thank you payment on time, on for gentle reminder, one for firm reminder with suggestion for alternate payment like (changing the payment to installments, partial payment/minimal payment), and notice of termination of service for non-payment.
6. **e-Invoice Solution**: Is Axrail the preferred vendor, or should we evaluate others from AWS Marketplace? - we will suggest Axrail since it is the sponsor of the hackathon.
7. **Analytics Depth**: What level of financial analytics is required for MVP vs. future phases? - MVP should focus on basic analytics like DSO, overdue invoices, and cash flow forecasts. Advanced analytics can be phased in later.
8. **Security/Compliance**: Any additional compliance requirements beyond LHDN (e.g., ISO, GDPR)? - It will be only LHDN compliance for now.

- Integrate Axrail e-Invoice Solution for LHDN compliance (unless you specify another vendor)
- Use SageMaker for payment prediction and cash flow forecasting, Kendra for search, QuickSight for dashboards
- Implement IAM-based access control and encryption for all sensitive data
- Build the system as modular microservices for easy future expansion

# Technical Proposal: Finnovate AI

## Executive Summary

Finnovate AI is an automated, AI-driven solution designed to streamline the entire "invoice-to-cash" process for B2B SaaS companies. This proposal outlines the technical implementation approach for building this platform using AWS services, with a focus on addressing the key pain points identified:

1. Fragmented billing systems requiring manual intervention
2. Inconsistent follow-up processes for overdue payments
3. Poor visibility into customer payment patterns
4. Manual reconciliation between usage data and billing
5. Compliance with Malaysia's e-Invoicing regulations (July 2025 deadline)

## System Architecture Overview

The Finnovate AI platform will be built as a cloud-native application on AWS, utilizing a serverless architecture wherever possible to minimize operational overhead and maximize scalability. The system consists of four key components:

1. **Data Integration and Automation Hub**
2. **AI-Driven Collections and Communication Engine**
3. **Financial Analysis and Visibility Platform**
4. **Regulatory Compliance Framework**

- Implement API Gateway, Lambda functions, and DynamoDB for core data integration
- Set up S3 storage for invoice documents
- Create basic invoice generation workflows
- Establish connections with primary external systems

### Phase 2: e-Invoicing Compliance (2 months)

- Implement validation workflows
- Test with LHDN sandbox environment
- Set up monitoring for compliance status

### Phase 3: AI Collections Engine (3 months)
- Implement Bedrock agents for collections
- Set up communication workflows with SES and SNS
- Develop Step Functions for collection orchestration
- Train and deploy initial communication models

### Phase 4: Analytics and Visibility (2 months)

- Develop user portals for insights access

## Technical Cautions and Limitations

1. **Integration Complexity**:
   - External system APIs may change without notice
   - Data format inconsistencies between systems require robust error handling
   - Recommendation: Implement adapter pattern and schema validation

2. **AI Limitations**:
   - Bedrock models require monitoring for hallucinations
   - Initial accuracy may be limited until models learn from real-world data
   - Recommendation: Implement human review for high-value communications initially

3. **Regulatory Compliance**:
   - e-Invoicing requirements may evolve before the July 2025 deadline
   - Recommendation: Build flexible implementation that can adapt to changing requirements

4. **Data Quality**:
   - Analytics and forecasting heavily depend on clean, consistent data
   - Recommendation: Implement data quality checks and cleansing pipelines

5. **Operational Considerations**:
   - Serverless architecture requires different monitoring approaches
   - Recommendation: Implement distributed tracing with AWS X-Ray

## Cost Optimization Strategies

1. **Serverless Right-Sizing**:
   - Configure Lambda functions with appropriate memory allocation
   - Optimize Lambda code for efficiency to reduce execution time

2. **Storage Tiering**:
   - Implement S3 lifecycle policies to move older invoices to lower-cost storage tiers
   - Use S3 Intelligent-Tiering for optimal cost management

3. **Database Optimization**:
   - Choose between provisioned and on-demand capacity based on usage patterns
   - Implement TTL for transient data

4. **Analytics Cost Control**:
   - Schedule SageMaker models to run during off-peak hours
   - Use Spot Instances for training where appropriate
   - Implement data aggregation to reduce QuickSight SPICE capacity needs

## Next Steps

1. Gather additional requirements and confirm implementation priorities
2. Develop detailed technical specifications for Phase 1 components
3. Create proof-of-concept for key integrations
4. Refine implementation timeline based on business priorities
5. Establish development and testing environments in AWS
